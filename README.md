# EngineDyno
Dyno measure based on logs and real data

This project aims at measuring dyno data mainly based on timestamp, vehicle speed and rpm

All the values will depend on Vehicle mass, Air Density, Outdoor temperature/humidity, SCx, drivetrain loss and rolling resistance


The program is made to retrieve data based on VCDS logs but can be adjusted to read other CSV files

At the end you will see a Dyno graph including torque and power
