# EngineDyno

**Dyno measurement based on logs and real data**

This project aims to compute dyno data based mainly on timestamp, vehicle speed, and RPM.

All values depend on:
- vehicle mass
- air density / pressure
- outdoor temperature / humidity
- SCx
- drivetrain loss
- rolling resistance

The program is designed to retrieve data based on **VCDS logs**, but can be adjusted to read other CSV files.

At the end, you will see a dyno graph including **torque** and **power**.

## Requirements

For this to work, you need to modify your ECU map to create a custom log channel that includes both **RPM** and **vehicle speed**.

üìñ A tutorial can be found here:  
[https://www.ecuconnections.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=23324](https://www.ecuconnections.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=23324)

Log data on a **flat road**, record:
- temperature
- air pressure
- humidity  

‚Ä¶and make a full-throttle log from **low to high RPM**.  
Run the program and carefully set all parameters to accurate values.

## VCDS Column Mapping

The time stamp, vehicle speed, and RPM columns refer to the VCDS log columns:

- **Group A**: time stamp (1), vehicle speed (2), RPM (3) ‚Üí starts at 1  
- **Group B**: time stamp (6), vehicle speed (7), RPM (8) ‚Üí starts at 6  
- **Group C**: time stamp (11), vehicle speed (12), RPM (13) ‚Üí starts at 11  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Be careful to have all data in the same group** ‚Äî otherwise, data retrieval could lead to inconsistencies (e.g. not reading RPM at the same time as vehicle speed).

## Definitions

- **SCx**: Drag surface (Cx √ó S)

- **Crr**: Rolling resistance coefficient

## How to Run the Program

To get started with the EngineDyno program, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   Before running the program, you need to install the required dependencies. In the project folder, you should find a `requirements.txt` file. To install the necessary packages, run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Run the Program**
   After installing the dependencies, you can execute the program. Make sure to adjust the parameters (such as temperature, air pressure, and rolling resistance) to your actual conditions for accurate results.

Enjoy.
